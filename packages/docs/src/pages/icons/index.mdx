# Icons

Icons are provided by the @fronnt/icons package. The package contains all icons as SVG files.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup>
import { NNIcon } from "@fronnt/components-vue";
</script>

<template>
  <NNIcon name="arrow" />
</template>
```

Icons can also be imported as raw SVG code (e.g. using Vite's `raw` directive) and bundled into your source code.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Arrow from "@fronnt/icons/arrow?raw";
</script>

<template>
  <i v-html="Arrow" />
</template>
```
